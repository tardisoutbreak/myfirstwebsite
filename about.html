         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <p>Welcome to the Intergalactic Indigo Latte Café, inspired by Doctor Who’s ‘Daleks in Manhattan’ episodes.</p>
    <img width="90%" src="coffee_bar 1.jpeg" alt="Picture of a modern coffee bar">
     <p>The Intergalactic Indigo Latte Café is uniquely situated in both the lower entrance and the 3rd floor of St. Ann's House, located in the heart of St. Ann's Square, Manchester, UK. This historic spot is just steps away from the iconic Royal Exchange Theatre, a venue beloved by actor Andrew Garfield, who performed there and starred in the Doctor Who episodes that inspired the café's creation.
         The café preserves the building's historic charm while blending it seamlessly with its futuristic, intergalactic theme. From the outside, it appears as a classic Manchester establishment, with elegant Georgian architecture that subtly hints at the extraordinary experience within.
         Upon entering, visitors are transported to a world where vintage Earth meets futuristic space travel. The café's layout reflects its dual inspiration:
         <p>The Astral Atrium: A high-ceilinged central area with hanging star-shaped lights that mimic constellations visible from Earth and beyond. The windows frame a view of St. Ann’s Square, connecting the grounded location to its cosmic theme. <img width="65%" src="DALL·E 2025-01-17 17.22.15 - An ethereal Astral Atrium with a slightly smaller, more intimate layout. The domed ceiling still features a swirling galaxy with glowing stars and neb.webp" alt="A picture of the Astrial Atrium"> 
             The Galaxy Corridor: A hallway lined with panels that glow softly, simulating the streaking lights of a spaceship in hyperspace, leading guests to different sections of the café. <img width="65%" src="DALL·E 2025-01-22 15.09.37 - A mesmerizing galaxy-themed corridor designed to captivate visitors.

             The Cosmic Nook: A snug seating area featuring cozy booths, each named after a different celestial body, from the Andromeda Booth to the Polaris Lounge. <img width="75%" src="DALL·E 2025-01-17 17.22.28 - A cozy café interior featuring long farmhouse dining tables paired with benches and bistro chairs painted in indigo and rust.

             The Skylight Bar: Under a large skylight, this section lets patrons sip coffee while gazing at a projection of Manchester’s sky, layered with imagined constellations from the café’s “fictional” galaxy. <img width="65%" src="DALL·E 2025-01-17 17.22.03 - A stylish skylight bar in a café with a celestial theme.

         <p>Subtle nods to Andrew Garfield's love of the Royal Exchange Theatre are found throughout, such as a dedicated Performance Corner where local actors and artists can showcase their talents, inspired by Garfield's journey from Manchester to international stardom.</p>          
         The heart of the Intergalactic Indigo Latte Café is its main room, styled to resemble a 1930s showgirl dressing room/green room.<img width="75%" src="DALL·E 2025-01-17 17.22.20 - A vintage 1930s showgirl dressing table paired with a wardrobe rail holding a glamorous showgirl costume. The dressing table features a large circular.webp" alt="A picture of one of 3 1930's style dressing tables"> This area is designed for patrons to enjoy their meals in a welcoming yet thematically rich environment.
         The centerpiece of this room is the set of farmhouse-style long tables, inspired by the pig slaves from the "Daleks in Manhattan" and "Evolution of the Daleks" episodes. The seating is an eclectic mix, with benches on one side and bistro chairs on the other, painted in hues of indigo, rust, and tea rose—a palette chosen to evoke both the café's intergalactic theme and its ties to vintage elegance.
         Subtle nods to the café's Doctor Who inspiration are scattered throughout the room. Among the vintage décor, observant guests may notice a model of the Liberty Bell, a small Dalek figurine tucked into a display, or a mural that seamlessly blends the Manhattan skyline with alien landscapes. These Easter eggs invite fans to explore and connect with the episodes that inspired the café’s creation.
         The warm lighting and theatrical ambiance encourage patrons to linger, creating a space where history, sci-fi, and community come together.

<h2>The Story Behind the Intergalactic Indigo Latte Café</h2>
<p>The story of the Intergalactic Indigo Latte Café begins in the shadowed alleys of 1930s Manhattan, where Frank, a kind-hearted dreamer, found himself caught up in the terrifying events of the Dalek invasion ("Daleks in Manhattan" and "Evolution of the Daleks"). After narrowly escaping the clutches of the Daleks and witnessing the chaos and resilience of those around him, Frank vowed to create something that would unite people rather than divide them—a place where stories could be shared, hope could flourish, and the scars of the past could heal.
Years later, after his extraordinary encounter with the Doctor, Frank’s life took an unexpected turn. Inspired by his time on Hooverville and the spirit of community he experienced there, Frank became a traveler in his own right. Legend has it that he stumbled upon a mysterious blueprint—perhaps left behind by the Doctor or another time traveler—that described a café unlike any other.
Using these plans, Frank opened the first iteration of the café in a forgotten corner of Manhattan, blending his love of the 1930s with a futuristic, interstellar twist. While the café in its current form resides in St. Ann’s Square, Manchester, it is said to carry forward Frank’s vision of hope and connection. The choice of location is no coincidence—it reflects Frank’s deep admiration for artistic spaces like the nearby Royal Exchange Theatre, a place of storytelling and performance that he would have cherished.
The café’s thematic design pays homage to the trials Frank endured and the people he fought to protect. The farmhouse tables in the 1930s dressing room-themed main area reflect the unity of the Hooverville residents, while subtle Easter eggs—like a cracked Liberty Bell and nods to the Dalek hybrid experiments—tie the space to Frank’s harrowing journey.
Over time, the café has become a hub for fans of the Doctor and casual visitors alike, uniting people across time, space, and fandoms. Whether it’s through its whimsical menu, intergalactic décor, or heartfelt story, the Intergalactic Indigo Latte Café reminds everyone who visits that even in the darkest times, community and connection can shine like a beacon across the stars.
